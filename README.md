# ReactMobileApp

As one might expect it's a mobile app built using react-native.

## BUILD
Run:
* npm install
* rnpm link
* See https://github.com/lelandrichardson/react-native-maps/issues/371
* cp settings.json.dist settings.json
* react-native run-ios (or xcode or whatever)

## CUSTOMIZING
Change settings.json as needed

Browsing the API URLs will show the expected formatting but you're on your own to implement equivalents for your content.
